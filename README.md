Thyroid disease prediction


Thyroid Disease Detection Application
Overview
This Python application is designed to predict the likelihood of thyroid disease based on patient data. Thyroid disease is a common endocrine disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and treatment are crucial for managing this condition effectively. This application aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing thyroid disease by analyzing patient information.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The application preprocesses the input data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical patient data to predict the probability of thyroid disease.
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for entering patient information and obtaining predictions.
Interpretability: Offers insights into the factors contributing to the prediction, allowing healthcare professionals to understand the model's decision-making process.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for developing the application.
Scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Pandas: Data manipulation library used for handling datasets.
Flask: Web framework used for building the user interface.

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask application using python app.py.
Access the application through a web browser at http://localhost:5000.
Enter the patient's information into the provided fields.
Click the "Predict" button to obtain the thyroid disease prediction.
Dataset
The application utilizes a dataset containing anonymized patient information, including demographic data, medical history, and thyroid function tests. The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.
